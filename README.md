# Nimvelo-Dialer
Dial from your computer, manage your address book and get notificaitions for incoming calls on your Simwood Hosted PBX.

This app is based on the original Nimvelo plugin for Chrome http://github.com/nimvelo/chrome-extension/ that has now been removed from the Chrome store.
It uses the Simwood Hosted API documented at https://developer.simwood.com/docs/direct/introduction

At the moment this application is in beta stage and should only be used with caution.

For Mac users once you have installed it you need to run this command in terminal as we have not signed the package
xattr -cr /Applications/NimveloDialer.app
